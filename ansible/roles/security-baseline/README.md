This role demonstrates at a principled applicaiton of the Center of Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks toa  Fedora 43 workstation,

The result reflects an engineering-level understanding of why controls exist, when to apply them, and how to adapt enterprise security
frameworks to real-world environments.
